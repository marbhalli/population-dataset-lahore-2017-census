Hi y'all

This repo contains the entirety of population dataset we have made at Team UrbanTech. A few points on the folders:
1. Master Folders: They contain a geopackage file for each unit of analysis i.e, tehsil, charge, and circle, respectively. The file has various household and population characteristics, the details of which can be found in the attached report.
2. Individual Tehsil Folders: They contain further subdirectories namely, circle, charge, and tehsil, each of which includes a geopackage file and csv file
for that respective unit of analysis.
3. Lahore Master CSV Folder: Contains all CSV files for Lahore, which have households, population, and electoral characteristics.

Feel free to contact in case of any queries
