This repository contains the entirety of the population dataset we have made at Team UrbanTech. A few points on the folders:
1. Master Folders: They contain a geopackage file for each unit of analysis i.e., tehsil, charge, and circle, respectively. The file has various household and population characteristics, which can be found in the attached report.
2. Individual Tehsil Folders: They contain further subdirectories, namely, circle, charge, and tehsil, each of which includes a geopackage file and CSV file
for that respective unit of analysis.
3. Lahore Master CSV Folder: Contains all CSV files for Lahore, which have households, population, and electoral characteristics.
